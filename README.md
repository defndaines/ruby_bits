Ruby Bits
=========

Repository for my Ruby code. Includes reference code samples and explorations that don't fit into independent projects.

My biggest Ruby effort to date is the [nexpose-client](https://github.com/rapid7/nexpose-client) gem, which I maintained while working at [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/).
